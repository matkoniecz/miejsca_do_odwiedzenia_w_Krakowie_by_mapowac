NEVER EVER COPY THIS DATA WITHOUT VISITING THIS PLACES!

I am not sure about license and it does not matter as data provided by the city is apparently good enough for their uses but not for our: differences between actual data regularly is greater than 100 meters.

Use ONLY for finding places worth surveying. Maybe also as hint/confirmation for `operator` data.
